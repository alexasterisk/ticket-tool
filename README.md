# ticket-tool
An old, currently un-updated Ticket tool bot for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) using [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/).

I probably will never come back to this project just because Discord is already filled with Ticket Tools.
Honestly I made this out of spite of not wanting to pay money for Ticket Tool to have different categories of tickets.

This was also designed around the time that Discord threads came out too. So it was pretty much the first Ticket Bot to integrate Threads.
This can now be seen with other Ticketing bots, but I may come back to this if I ever want my own, custom Ticket Tool that does exactly what I want it to.

One good thing about being a programmer is when you have an issue with something, just do it yourself. Either you'll encounter why it was made a certain way, or you'll just develop more skills in making it yourself.
